I work at the College of Business as a study abroad advisor, assisting students interested in studying abroad and connecting them with the many resources UT Austin offers to help them gain global experiences. Additionally, I am the Founder and President of UT Austin's first international business club, the International Business Alliance (IBA). This organization is dedicated to helping students—regardless of their major—achieve their goals of studying or working abroad by increasing awareness of the vast opportunities available at UT Austin. I aspire to leverage my academic and professional experiences to become a foreign diplomat for the U.S. Embassy, focusing on the Middle East and Asia. As a Gilman Scholar Recipient, my experiences studying abroad in Germany, Spain, and South Korea will support me in pursuing this career path.",
