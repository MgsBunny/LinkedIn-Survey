  "about": "Hi, my name is Ashley Merritt, and I recently graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor's degree in Management. Iâ€™m passionate about social media, marketing, management, and real estate, and I aim to help businesses effectively promote their goods and services through innovative marketing strategies. I completed a seven-month internship at Mechanical One as a marketing intern, where I learned how to use Photoshop and WordPress, conducted market research, managed social media accounts, created marketing materials, and assisted on set for filming commercials. Additionally, I have worked as a lifeguard and swim coach at my local country club, which has helped me develop essential skills in communication, leadership, and responsibility. Iâ€™m proficient in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, and I have a basic working knowledge of Spanish. Now that I have graduated, Iâ€™m eager to find a fulfilling job and eventually pursue a Masterâ€™s degree.",
